# What's next from the convergence of computing technologies
At IBM Research, we have a long history of cutting-edge computing innovation. We also have a track-record of combining our knowledge of AI with a deep understanding of science. As you learned about in last year’s letter, accelerated discovery builds on that heritage by leveraging classical computing — particularly AI, cloud, and quantum computing to accelerate the discovery of solutions that aim to make a substantial impact on the world. In 2023, we explored applying accelerated discovery to drug discovery, materials science, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. We also have our earliest examples of how quantum computing could provide a unique advantage in addressing problems in high-energy physics and cell-centric therapeutics.

## Accelerating drug discovery
Researchers are moving into a new era of AI-enabled drug discovery that will accelerate the development of life-changing medicines. Last year, we shared our work integrating AI for knowledge ingestion with physics-based simulations and deep learning surrogates, automated hypothesis generation, and cloud-based experimentation. We told you about our framework for molecular generative model, where we leverage generative AI to represent the structure of molecules and predict new molecular designs. In 2023, we kept pushing the boundaries of what we can do with such integration of computing technologies and applied it to the problem of assessing whether islet autoantibody screening is effective for predicting type 1 diabetes in adolescents. We believe that scaling access to these technologies will provide a step change in drug discovery timelines.

## Accelerating materials science
Drug discovery is only the beginning. In 2023, we presented a foundation model for material science that incorporates multiple representations of a material and data modalities on a united latent space. We also built a model that unifies molecular and textual representations through multi-task language modeling and proposed the Regression Transformer, a method that abstracts regression as a conditional sequence modeling problem to make generative AI more controllable.

## AI for carbon capture
A separate but related example is carbon capture chemistry. Carbon capture, storage, and utilization is considered one of the key strategies required to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and their impacts on climate change. However, despite decades of intensive research, making carbon capture economically viable remains an enormous challenge. Most high-throughput computational screening studies for carbon capture and related problems use grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations that depend on the choice of force field parameters and partial charges. Therefore, we need databases to do a comprehensive impact evaluation. In 2023, we presented a database of simulations of CO2 and N2 adsorption isotherms on 690 metal-organic frameworks taken from the CoRE MOF 2014 database. The result is CRAFTED, (Charge dependent, Reproducible, Accessible, Forcefield-dependent, and Temperature-dependent Exploratory Database of adsorption isotherms). CRAFTED provides a convenient platform to explore the sensitivity of simulation outcomes to molecular modeling choices at the material (structure-property relationship) and process levels (structure-property-performance relationship).
